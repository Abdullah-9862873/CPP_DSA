Breadth First Search--->

Breadth-first search is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for 
        a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and 
        explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes 
        at the next depth level.

        The traversal here is also known as level order traversal

        It is implemented using Queues

Depth First Seardch--->

        Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or 
                graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node 
                (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of 
                a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch 
                before backtracking.

        Implemented using stacks
